To reduce scrolling in both login and register pages, I need to:

1. Reduce title from 42px to 32px
2. Reduce header marginBottom from 40px to 20px
3. Reduce icon size from 64px to 48px  
4. Reduce padding: 20px → 16px
5. Reduce inputGroup marginBottom: 20px → 14px
6. Reduce formContent padding: 24px → 18px
7. Reduce button margins
8. Reduce footer marginTop: 32px → 16px

This will make both pages fit better on screen with less scrolling.
